# Project 5: Recognition using Deep Networks

## Overview
Project 5 involves training and testing deep network models. We used the MNIST dataset for recognition. The project helped demonstrate the capabilities that deep networks possess in accomplishing computer vision tasks.


## Time Travel days
Used for this project: 2

## Development Environment
Operating System: Windows 10 64 bit \
IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022/Visual Studio 2019  \
OpenCV version: 4.5.1

## Project Structure
Ensure the following files are in your directory.

```
│   task_1_A_E.py
│   task_1_F.py
│   task_1_G.py
│   task_2.py
│   task_3_ext_2.py
│   task_4.py
│   extension_1.py
│   extension_3.py
│   Resized Handwritten Numbers.zip
│   Resized Handwritten Greek Letters.zip
|   Additional Resized Handwritten Greek Letters.zip
│   ReadME.md
│   Project 5 Report.pdf
```

## How to run
1. Each file runs the tasks described in the file name. More description on the comments of the main function.
2. Include the correct path name for Handwritten Numbers/Letters depending on the program running

## Extensions
### 1. Loading a pre trained model and evaluating its first couple of convolutional layers as in task 2
1. Run the file extension_1.py.
### 2. Try more greek letters than alpha, beta and gamma
1. Run the file task_3_ext_2.py.
### 3. Explore a different computer vision task with available data
1. Run the file extension_3.py.
